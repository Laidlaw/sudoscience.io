title: Why The Newsletter?
---

So I bet you’re wondering why you joined this weekly newsletter. If you know me, you’re just morbidly curious about what the disaster this will become.[^1]

[^1]:And I respect that.

For those of you who don’t know me, I have predicted every major **paradigm shift** in the tech industry. I predicted the rise of **conversational interfaces** and **bots**. Before that, I predicted **flat design**. I predicted **javascript**.[^3]

[^3]:pronounced "*yah-vascript*"

I have consumed every article, ebook, podcast and programming language that you will one day ever regret missing.[^2]

[^2]:Like that episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer where they supposedly sang the whole time.

## Need proof? Here are some articles that I have read:

* ### [Paul Ford: What is Code? | Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/)

> What do you need to know about code to survive in a suspicious world?

* ### [Web Design - The First 100 Years](http://idlewords.com/talks/web_design_first_100_years.htm)

> This is the expanded version of a talk I gave on September 9, 2014, at the HOW Interactive Design conference in Washington, DC.

* ### [Magic Ink: Information Software and the Graphical Interface](http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/)

> The ubiquity of frustrating, unhelpful software interfaces has motivated decades of research into “Human-Computer Interaction.” In this paper, I suggest that the long-standing focus on “interaction” may be misguided. For a majority subset of software, called “information software,” I argue that interactivity is actually a curse for users and a crutch for designers, and users’ goals can be better satisfied through other means.

* ### [Emergent Layers, Chapter 1: Scarcity, Abstraction & Abundance — The Startup — Medium](https://medium.com/swlh/emergent-layers-chapter-1-scarcity-abstraction-abundance-5705666e4f15#.nrbwdvek5)

> This is part 1 of a four-part series, Emergent Layers. If you haven’t read the introduction, I invite you to do so here.


## Let Me Guide You
**Sudoscience**, like **COBOL** and **Project Xanadu**, was made to prepare us for the next paradigm shift, the Big One.

I’m already there, I’ve been down that path because I’ve already predicted it. It’s really bad and it’s not what you think. Except for AI, you got that right.

By subscribing to this newsletter, you are receiving a cairn in your inbox every week. A *cairn* is a pile of stacked rocks made in the wilderness by a journeyman or *spiritually centered person*. When it works, cairns warn you about dangerous turns in the future. But other times, cairns look like a dog shit art gallery.[^4]

Similarly, in **Sudoscience**, you’ll find the pomposity of a populist mixed with [the charming and terrifying clumsiness of an autonomous drone learning to fly](https://youtu.be/VCdxqn0fcnE).
